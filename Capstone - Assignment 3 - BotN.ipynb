    "#### The client is a black belt in Brazilian Jiujitsu, and is looking to open up her own martial arts studio in the Toronto. She has asked for a recommendation on where to start her business. \n",
    "#### The client asks that the criteria for the recommendation be based on the following priorities:\n",
    "#### - First and foremost, she is focused on quickly creating a profitable business. Therefore the region she selects should have lower competition to allow for faster growth. The area she selects to start her business needs to have a smaller ratio of studios relative to the number of people so that she can easily compete as a newcomer.\n",
    "#### - She is interested in starting her business in an area where she can make a big impact and have the greatest opportunity to grow a large membership base. An area with a higher population and a higher density will mean the business is closer and accessible to more people. \n",
    "#### - Since doing martial arts can be an expensive hobby, she would like to make sure that the region where she sets up her business is an affluent one. A region where more households are making more than 100000 dollars mean that the people who live there can more easily afford Brazilian Jiujitsu for the whole family.\n"
